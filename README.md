### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The project aimed to create an advising program at ABC University to load, store, and display course information efficiently. The challenge was to decide on the appropriate data structure for the task—Vector, Hash Table, or Binary Search Tree (BST)—based on time complexity, memory usage, and scalability.

### How did you approach the problem?
I analyzed the runtime and memory benefits of each data structure to see what was the most efficient for storing and searching course data. I decided to use the Binary Search Tree (BST), as it keeps the courses sorted automatically and can be searched efficiently using in-order traversal. This reinforced why it is critical to choose the right data structure before the actual coding process begins.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Some challenges were to process badly malformed input lines and make sure prerequisites between classes were handled. I handled these issues by implementing helper functions to trim and confirm clean input data, as well as by typing in loads of different CSV files to make sure it handled the bad-data input gracefully. Once I was able to debug line by line, I could identify where errors were happening, and, more importantly, why they occurred. 

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? 
This project improved how I plan and structure programs. I learned to think about data organization, runtime efficiency, and scalability before writing code. Designing the pseudocode first also helped me visualize logic flow and avoid confusion during implementation.


### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
I learned the importance of writing code that is clear, organized, and easy for others to understand. By breaking the program into smaller functions that handle specific tasks such as loading files, searching data, and printing results, I was able to simplify testing and debugging. This project helped me appreciate the value of creating code that is clean, reusable, and flexible for future projects.
